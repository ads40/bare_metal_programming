# Learning about Programming on Bare Metal Devices

Here we learn about programming directly on bare metal computing devices, such
as the Raspberry Pi 4.

This touches on topics from CPU architecture, to the operations of a board, to
low level programming in C, through to building up operating system services and
then programming on top of these.

The purpose of these writings is to document a learning path and to try to
uncover as much of the underlying assumptions and required knowledge as
possible. The layers of abstraction are what makes modern computing possible,
but also challenging to get one's head around, especially at the start.
